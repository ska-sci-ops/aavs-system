# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#stages
# GitLab CI in conjunction with GitLab Runner can use Docker Engine to test and build any application.
# Docker, when used with GitLab CI, runs each job in a separate and isolated container using the predefined image that is set up in .gitlab-ci.yml.
# In this case we use the latest python docker image to build and test this project.

# cache is used to specify a list of files and directories which should be cached between jobs. You can only use paths that are within the project workspace.
# If cache is defined outside the scope of jobs, it means it is set globally and all jobs will use that definition

  stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
