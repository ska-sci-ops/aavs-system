Configuration to communicate with TPM:
--------------------------------------

Virtual Machine must be set on NAT 
One of the network interfaces on the host must be set to an IP on the same subnet as that of the TPM (default:10.0.10.0/24)

Setting up the TANGO device server:
----------------------------------

Start Device server (or any DS) in test branch with specified logging level
python devices_new/Tile_DS test -v4

Add devices to database (will be updated):
python clients/addDeviceServer.py 

Stop Device server:
Kill

Nots:
- A DS process per device type is required to run (multiple processes)
- How do we know which DS to launch as startup?
